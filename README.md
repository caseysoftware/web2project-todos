TodoList v2.0

** This module will not work with any version of web2project prior to v3.0-pre! **

The TodoList module handles simple todo management for web2project. These todo items are usually things that are either done or not done in minutes as opposed to hours or days. Therefore, they don't make sense as Tasks. These items can optionally be attached to specific Projects, Contacts, or both.

COMPATIBLE VERSIONS

=====================================

*  v2.0+ of this module has been validated to work with web2project v3.0-pre and above and is known to be incompatible with earlier releases.

*  v1.1 has been validated to work with the current Web2project v2.0 and above.

*  This won't work with dotProject, don't even bother trying.
